# Timeline

Timeline helps to quickly generate a Gantt chart with Google Timeline js library, so you can keep your project schedule most updated.

| Operating System | Binary                   |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Windows          | [Here](bin/timeline.exe) |
| Linux            | [Here](bin/timeline)     |

__Source__
Or you can just install in with Go install from the source

`
git clone https://github.com/billylkc/timeline
cd timeline
go install
`
